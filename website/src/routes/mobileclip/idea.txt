ok now in the mobileclip page, let's make a minimalist and clean ui scaffold from which i can make mobileclip2 demo. as a ui, i want something with the vibe of same.energy, screenshot below

except maybe for this ui, it starts as a corpus of images and text. there will be two views, list (default) and grid (let's not think about this one yet).

the big bar at the top lets you enter text, and as you type it computes embeddings ("computed in 2ms") and then filters the corpus list below it accordingly

the corpus is of text and images, it shows you the top matches to your text, divided with sections with stars (THREE STAR close match, TWO STAR match, ONE STAR slight match) and it has the picture along with the match score % (dot product cosine dist)

by default there is no data, so there are no matches. the empty state should prompt you to insert more data, either by uploading text/image files or by giving you options to download prepared datasets (images from an art museum, or sentences from the little price, etc.)

alright I know that's a lot, but let's start with just the ui skeleton (non-functional) and we'll fill in things as we go. minimalist vibe, clean simple lines, white background, no gradients, no shadows
