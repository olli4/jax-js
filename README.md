# jax-js with `lax.scan`

This is an unofficial jax-js version with `lax.scan` implemented by an AI coding agent under human
supervision. For more information see
[.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md#part-2-scan-feature-reference).

You can use this by adding to your package.json:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@jax-js/jax": "git+https://github.com/olli4/jax-js.git#feat/scan"
  },
```

# Function: scan

Scan a function over leading array axes while carrying along state. Think of `scan` as a functional
`reduce` that also returns all intermediate results. It iterates over the leading axis of `xs`,
threading a "carry" value through each step and collecting outputs.

---

## Type signature

```ts
scan(f, init, xs) → [finalCarry, ys]
scan(f, init, null, { length }) → [finalCarry, ys]  // carry-only scan

// Where:
// f: (carry: C, x: X | null) => [C, Y | null]  -- step function
// init: C                               -- initial carry
// xs: X[] | null                        -- input array or null for carry-only
// finalCarry: C                         -- carry after last iteration
// ys: Y[] | null                        -- stacked outputs (null if Y=null)
```

### Type parameters

- `Carry extends JsTree<Array>`
- `X extends JsTree<Array> | null | undefined`
- `Y extends JsTree<Array> | null`

---

## Semantics

Roughly equivalent JS implementation:

```js
function scan(f, init, xs) {
  let carry = init;
  const ys = [];
  for (const x of xs) {
    const [newCarry, y] = f(carry, x);
    carry = newCarry;
    ys.push(y);
  }
  return [carry, np.stack(ys)];
}
```

Differences vs a plain JS loop:

- `xs` and `ys` can be arbitrary pytrees (nested objects/arrays).
- The scan can be compiled to efficient native code (WASM/WebGPU).
- Supports autodiff: `grad(f)` works through `scan`.
- Carry shape/dtype must be fixed across iterations.

---

## Reference-counting contract

**Inputs (consumed):**

- `init` and `xs` are consumed by `scan` (refcount decremented).
- Use `.ref` if you need to keep inputs alive: `scan(f, init.ref, xs.ref)`.

**Body function:**

- `carry` and `x` are **borrowed** — do NOT dispose them inside the body.
- Return **new** arrays for `newCarry` and `y`.
- For passthrough (same array used as both carry and output), use `.ref`: `[result.ref, result]`.

**Outputs (caller owns):**

- `finalCarry` and `ys` are owned by the caller — dispose when done.

---

## Parameters

- `f(carry, x) => [newCarry, y]` — step function
  - `carry`: current state (same structure as `init`)
  - `x`: slice of `xs` along axis 0, or `null` when `xs` is `null`
  - `newCarry`: updated state (same structure/shape as `carry`)
  - `y`: output for the iteration, or `null` to skip stacking

- `init` — initial carry (array or pytree)
- `xs` — input sequence or `null` (when `null`, you must provide `{ length }`)
- `options` — `number | ScanOptions` (legacy `length` number supported)

### ScanOptions

- `length?: number` — iteration count (required if `xs === null`).
- `reverse?: boolean` — process `xs` in reverse order (default `false`).
- `requirePath?: ScanPath | ScanPath[]` — require a specific implementation path (e.g., `"fused"`).

---

## Returns

`[finalCarry, ys]` where:

- `finalCarry` has the same structure as `init`.
- `ys` matches the shape/structure of `y` returned by `f`, with an added leading axis of size
  `length`. If the body returns `null` for `y`, then `ys` is `null` and no memory is allocated for
  stacked outputs.

---

## Examples (extracted from generated docs)

### Cumulative sum

```ts
const step = (carry, x) => {
  const sum = np.add(carry, x);
  return [sum, sum.ref];
};
const init = np.array([0.0]);
const xs = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]);
const [final, sums] = await lax.scan(step, init, xs);
// final = [15], sums = [[1],[3],[6],[10],[15]]
```

### Factorial

```ts
const step = (carry, x) => {
  const next = np.multiply(carry, x);
  return [next, next.ref];
};
const init = np.array([1]);
const xs = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]);
const [final, factorials] = await lax.scan(step, init, xs);
// factorials = [[1],[2],[6],[24],[120]]
```

### Pytree carry

```ts
const step = (carry, x) => {
  const newSum = np.add(carry.sum, x);
  const newCount = np.add(carry.count, np.array([1]));
  return [
    { sum: newSum.ref, count: newCount.ref },
    { sum: newSum, count: newCount },
  ];
};
const init = { sum: np.array([0]), count: np.array([0]) };
const xs = np.array([[10], [20], [30]]);
const [final, history] = await lax.scan(step, init, xs);
// final.sum = [60], final.count = [3]
```

### Carry-only scan (`xs = null`)

```ts
const step = (carry, _x) => {
  const next = np.add(carry.ref, np.array([1.0]));
  return [next, carry];
};
const init = np.array([0.0]);
const [final, ys] = await lax.scan(step, init, null, { length: 5 });
// ys = [0,1,2,3,4], final = [5]
```

### Skip output stacking (`Y = null`)

Return `null` for the per-iteration output to avoid allocating `ys` when only the final carry is
needed.

```ts
const step = (carry, x) => {
  const Asq = carry.A.ref.mul(carry.A);
  const newA = Asq.add(x);
  const newCount = carry.count.add(Asq.less(100).astype(np.int32));
  return [{ A: newA, count: newCount }, null];
};
```

### `jit(scan)` — compile whole loop (recommended)

```ts
const scanFn = jit((init, xs) => lax.scan(step, init, xs));
const [final, ys] = await scanFn(init, xs);
scanFn.dispose();
```

### `scan(jit(body))` — JIT-compile step only (JS loop)

Useful when the step is expensive but the loop control should remain in JS.

---

## Autodiff

- `grad` / JVP / VJP are supported through `scan`.
- Current implementation stores all intermediate carries for reverse-mode (O(N) memory).
- Roadmap: implement √N checkpointing to reduce memory to O(√N) with ~2× recompute.

---

## Implementation notes (where to look in the codebase)

- Frontend / tracing & Jaxpr: `src/library/lax-scan.ts`.
- Primitive: `Primitive.Scan` and backend lowerings (`native-scan`, `scan`).
- WebGPU/WASM codegen and scan-specific helpers: `src/backend/*` (see `scan-wrapper.ts`,
  `webgpu.ts`).
- Tests: `test/lax-scan.test.ts`, `test/jit-scan-dlm.test.ts`.

</strong></p>

**jax-js** is a machine learning framework for the browser. It aims to bring
[JAX](https://jax.dev)-style, high-performance CPU and GPU kernels to JavaScript, so you can run
numerical applications on the web.

```bash
npm i @jax-js/jax
```

Under the hood, it translates array operations into a compiler representation, then synthesizes
kernels in WebAssembly and WebGPU.

The library is written from scratch, with zero external dependencies. It maintains close API
compatibility with NumPy/JAX. Since everything runs client-side, jax-js is likely the most portable
GPU ML framework, since it runs anywhere a browser can run.

## Quickstart

```js
import { numpy as np } from "@jax-js/jax";

// Array operations, compatible with JAX/NumPy.
const x = np.array([1, 2, 3]);
const y = x.mul(4); // [4, 8, 12]
```

### Web usage (CDN)

In vanilla JavaScript (without a bundler), just import from a module script tag. This is the easiest
way to get started on a blank HTML page.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { numpy as np } from "https://esm.sh/@jax-js/jax";
</script>
```

## Tutorial

Programming in `jax-js` looks [very similar to JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax-101.html),
just in JavaScript.

### Arrays

Create an array with `np.array()`:

```ts
import { numpy as np } from "@jax-js/jax";

const ar = np.array([1, 2, 3]);
```

By default, this is a float32 array, but you can specify a different dtype:

```ts
const ar = np.array([1, 2, 3], { dtype: np.int32 });
```

For more efficient construction, create an array from a JS `TypedArray` buffer:

```ts
const buf = new Float32Array([10, 20, 30, 100, 200, 300]);
const ar = np.array(buf).reshape([2, 3]);
```

Once you're done with it, you can unwrap a `jax.Array` back into JavaScript. This will also apply
any pending operations or lazy updates:

```ts
// 1) Returns a possibly nested JavaScript array.
ar.js();
await ar.jsAsync(); // Faster, non-blocking

// 2) Returns a flat TypedArray data buffer.
ar.dataSync();
await ar.data(); // Fastest, non-blocking
```

Arrays can have mathematical operations applied to them. For example:

```ts
import { numpy as np, scipySpecial as special } from "@jax-js/jax";

const x = np.arange(100).astype(np.float32); // array of integers [0..99]

const y1 = x.ref.add(x.ref); // x + x
const y2 = np.sin(x.ref); // sin(x)
const y3 = np.tanh(x.ref).mul(5); // 5 * tanh(x)
const y4 = special.erfc(x.ref); // erfc(x)
```

Notice that in the above code, we used `x.ref`. This is because of the memory model, jax-js uses
reference-counted _ownership_ to track when the memory of an Array can be freed. More on this below.

### Reference counting

Big Arrays take up a lot of memory. Python ML libraries override the `__del__()` method to free
memory, but JavaScript has no such API for running object destructors
([cf.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)).
This means that you have to track references manually. jax-js tries to make this as ergonomic as
possible, so you don't accidentally leak memory in a loop.

Every `jax.Array` has a reference count. This satisfies the following rules:

- Whenever you create an Array, its reference count starts at `1`.
- When an Array's reference count reaches `0`, it is freed and can no longer be used.
- Given an Array `a`:
  - Accessing `a.ref` returns `a` and changes its reference count by `+1`.
  - Passing `a` into any function as argument changes its reference count by `-1`.
  - Calling `a.dispose()` also changes its reference count by `-1`.

What this means is that all functions in jax-js must _take ownership_ of their arguments as
references. Whenever you would like to pass an Array as argument, you can pass it directly to
dispose of it, or use `.ref` if you'd like to use it again later.

**You must follow these rules on your own functions as well!** All combinators like `jvp`, `grad`,
`jit` assume that you are following these conventions on how arguments are passed, and they will
respect them as well.

```ts
// Bad: Uses `x` twice, decrementing its reference count twice.
function foo_bad(x: np.Array, y: np.Array) {
  return x.add(x.mul(y));
}

// Good: The first usage of `x` is `x.ref`, adding +1 to refcount.
function foo_good(x: np.Array, y: np.Array) {
  return x.ref.add(x.mul(y));
}
```

Here's another example:

```ts
// Bad: Doesn't consume `x` in the `if`-branch.
function bar_bad(x: np.Array, skip: boolean) {
  if (skip) return np.zeros(x.shape);
  return x;
}

// Good: Consumes `x` the one time in each branch.
function bar_good(x: np.Array, skip: boolean) {
  if (skip) {
    const ret = np.zeros(x.shape);
    x.dispose();
    return ret;
  }
  return x;
}
```

You can assume that every function in jax-js takes ownership properly, except with a couple of very
rare exceptions that are documented.

### grad(), vmap() and jit()

JAX's signature composable transformations are also supported in jax-js. Here is a simple example of
using `grad` and `vmap` to compute the derivaive of a function:

```ts
import { numpy as np, grad, vmap } from "@jax-js/jax";

const x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000);

const y1 = vmap(grad(np.sin))(x.ref); // d/dx sin(x) = cos(x)
const y2 = np.cos(x);

np.allclose(y1, y2); // => true
```

The `jit` function is especially useful when doing long sequences of primitives on GPU, since it
fuses operations together into a single kernel dispatch. This
[improves memory bandwidth usage](https://substack.com/home/post/p-163548742) on hardware
accelerators, which is the bottleneck on GPU rather than raw FLOPs. For instance:

```ts
export const hypot = jit(function hypot(x1: np.Array, x2: np.Array) {
  return np.sqrt(np.square(x1).add(np.square(x2)));
});
```

Without JIT, the `hypot()` function would require four kernel dispatches: two multiplies, one add,
and one sqrt. JIT fuses these together into a single kernel that does it all at once.

All functional transformations can take typed `JsTree` of inputs and outputs. These are similar to
[JAX's pytrees](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pytrees.html), and it's basically just a structure of
nested JavaScript objects and arrays. For instance:

```ts
import { grad, numpy as np } from "@jax-js/jax";

type Params = {
  foo: np.Array;
  bar: np.Array[];
};

function getSums(p: Params) {
  const fooSum = p.foo.sum();
  const barSum = p.bar.map((x) => x.sum()).reduce(np.add);
  return fooSum.add(barSum);
}

grad(getSums)({
  foo: np.array([1, 2, 3]),
  bar: [np.array([10]), np.array([11, 12])],
});
// => { foo: [1, 1, 1], bar: [[1], [1, 1]] }
```

Note that you need to use `type` alias syntax rather than `interface` to define fine-grained
`JsTree` types.

### Devices

Similar to JAX, jax-js has a concept of "devices" which are a backend that stores Arrays in memory
and determines how to execute compiled operations on them.

There are currently 4 devices in jax-js:

- `cpu`: Slow, interpreted JS, only meant for debugging.
- `wasm`: [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), currently single-threaded and blocking.
- `webgpu`: [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API), available on
  [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS).
- `webgl`: [WebGL2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext), via
  fragment shaders. This is an older graphics API that runs on almost all browsers, but it is much
  slower than WebGPU. It's offered on a best-effort basis and not as well-supported.

**We recommend `webgpu` for best performance, especially when running neural networks.** The default
device is `wasm`, but you can change this at startup time:

```ts
import { defaultDevice, init } from "@jax-js/jax";

const devices = await init(); // Starts all available backends.

if (devices.includes("webgpu")) {
  defaultDevice("webgpu");
} else {
  console.warn("WebGPU is not supported, falling back to Wasm.");
}
```

You can also place individual arrays on specific devices:

```ts
import { devicePut, numpy as np } from "@jax-js/jax";

const ar = np.array([1, 2, 3]); // Starts with device="wasm"
await devicePut(ar, "webgpu"); // Now device="webgpu"
```

### Helper libraries

There are other libraries in the `@jax-js` namespace that can work with jax-js, or be used in a
self-contained way in other projects.

- [**`@jax-js/loaders`**](packages/loaders) can load tensors from various formats like Safetensors,
  includes a fast and compliant implementation of BPE, and caches HTTP requests for large assets
  like model weights in OPFS.
- [**`@jax-js/onnx`**](packages/onnx) is a model loader from the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format
  into native jax-js functions.
- [**`@jax-js/optax`**](packages/optax) provides implementations of optimizers like Adam and SGD.

### Performance

The WebGPU runtime includes an ML compiler with tile-aware optimizations, tuned for indiidual
browsers. Also, this library uniquely has the `jit()` feature that fuses operations together and
records an execution graph. jax-js achieves **over 7000 GFLOP/s** for matrix multiplication on an
Apple M4 Max chip ([try it](https://jax-js.com/bench/matmul)).

For that example, it's significantly faster than both
[TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) and
[ONNX Runtime Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onnxruntime-web), which both use handwritten
libraries of custom kernels.

It's still early though. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit to continue optimizing the library, as
well as unique optimizations such as FlashAttention variants.

### API Reference

That's all for this short tutorial. Please see the generated
[API reference](https://jax-js.com/docs) for detailed documentation.

## Examples

If you make something cool with jax-js, don't be a stranger! We can feature it here.

- [Training neural networks on MNIST](https://jax-js.com/mnist)
- [Voice cloning: Kyutai Pocket TTS](https://jax-js.com/tts)
- [CLIP embeddings for books in-browser](https://jax-js.com/mobileclip)
- [Object detection: DETR ResNet-50 (ONNX)](https://jax-js.com/detr-resnet-50)
- [In-browser REPL](https://jax-js.com/repl)
- [Matmul benchmark](https://jax-js.com/bench/matmul)
- [Conv2d benchmark](https://jax-js.com/bench/conv2d)
- [Mandelbrot set](https://jax-js.com/mandelbrot)

## Development

_The following technical details are for contributing to jax-js and modifying its internals._

This repository is managed by [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). You can compile and build all packages in
watch mode with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build:watch
```

The `pnpm install` command automatically sets up Git hooks via
[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). Pre-commit hooks will run ESLint and Prettier on staged
files to ensure code quality.

You can also run linting and formatting manually:

```bash
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm format        # Format all files with Prettier
pnpm format:check  # Check formatting without writing
pnpm check         # Run TypeScript type checking
```

Then you can run tests in a headless browser using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install
pnpm test
```

We are currently on an older version of Playwright that supports using WebGPU in headless mode;
newer versions skip the WebGPU tests.

To start a Vite dev server running the website, demos and REPL:

```bash
pnpm -C website dev
```

## Future work / help wanted

Contributions are welcomed! Some fruitful areas to look into:

- Adding support for more JAX functions and operations, see [compatibility table](./FEATURES.md).
- Improving performance of the WebGPU and Wasm runtimes, generating better kernels, and using SIMD
  and multithreading. (Even single-threaded Wasm could be ~20x faster.)
- Adding support for `jax.profiling`, in particular the start and end trace functions. We should be
  able to generate `traceEvents` from backends (especially on GPU, with precise timestamp queries)
  to help with model performance debugging.
- Helping the JIT compiler to fuse operations in more cases, like `tanh` branches.
- Making a fast transformer inference engine, comparing against onnxruntime-web.
